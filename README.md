# Special-Garbanzo-Tictactoe Project

Contributor **Phomolo Phiri**

This is a simple React application for the tic tac toe game. 
### Game Rules
1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.

To run the game type:
1. `npm install` to get all the dependencies
2. `npm start` to run the game on the local server.
